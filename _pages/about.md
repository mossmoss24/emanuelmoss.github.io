I am a cultural anthropologist who studies machine learning from an ethnographic perspective. I focus on the role of data scientists as producers of knowledge and how the authority of machine is constructed and challenged. I have written extensively on the operationalization of ethics in Silicon Valley and about algorithmic accountability.

I am currently a Joint Postdoctoral Fellow at the Cornell [Tech Digital Life Initiative](https://www.dli.tech.cornell.edu/) and the [Data & Society Research Institute](https://datasociety.net/research/ai-on-the-ground/) in New York City. I received my PhD. from the CUNY Graduate Center in 2021 for my dissertation, "The Objective Function: Science and Society in the Age of Machine Intelligence". I hold a B.A. in Anthropology from the University of Illinois and an M.A. in Global Studies from Brandeis University. I have previously worked as a digital and spatial information specialist for archaeological and environmental projects in the United States and Turkey.
